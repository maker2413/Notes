#+TITLE: Gradle Guide
#+PROPERTY: header-args

Gradle is an open source tool used to automate builds. It is versatile enough to
build almost any software. Gradle uses Java so having a JDK installed is the
only prerequiste to using gradle in your repo.

* What is special about Gradle?
  There are many other build tools out there like Maven or Ant to name a few so
  why would you use Gradle. Gradle doesn't really add anything to the software
  engineer world that one of those tools already does but rather is more of an
  amalgamation of the two.

* What does Gradle do for me?
  Gradle can just build and package your code but it does so much more than
  that. Gradle can also manage dependencies for your code. Gradle is also highly
  configurable which gives it the power to integrate with almost any code or
  software you can make. Gradle is also super fast because it support
  incremental releases. This means that it runs a daemon on your machine which
  caches built dependencies and keeps track of changes between builds so it only
  has to recompile affected code. Gradle also supports plugins developed by you
  or other members of the community so its uses are nearly endless. Gradle build
  instructions can either be written in Groovy or Kotlin.

* Okay I'm sold how do I start?
  Gradle can be installed on any machine with a JDK installed. You could build
  it yourself from source or you can install a package for your OS. In my case
  (arch linux) I just have to run ~pacman -S gradle~.

  Next we will go over some of the Gradle commands and give a description of
  what they do:
  | Command | Description                                              |
  |---------+----------------------------------------------------------|
  | init    | Used to initialize current directory as a gradle project |
  | tasks   | Used to list the tasks specified in build.gradle         |

  Lets now look at some example projects to get an idea of the directory
  structure gradle implements and some of the features these commands have.
  - [[./FirstProject/README.org][FirstProject]] :: This is a basic application generated by gradle. This project also goes over some of the basic groovy commands and how to use them.
  - [[./JavaProject/README.org][JavaProject]] :: This project is a simple Java project generated by gradle and I mainly cover the directory structure of a gradle java project.

* How does it all work?
  Lets work through the a sample =build.gradle= file to get a better
  understanding of what we are looking at.
  #+begin_example
    /*
     ,* This file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.
     ,*
     ,* This generated file contains a sample Java application project to get you started.

    plugins {
            // Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.
            id 'application'
    }

    repositories {
            // Use Maven Central for resolving dependencies.
            mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
            // Use JUnit test framework.
            testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.1'

            // This dependency is used by the application.
            implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:30.0-jre'
    }

    application {
            // Define the main class for the application.
            mainClass = 'com.maker2413.gradle.App'
    }
  #+end_example

** repositories {}
   In this example lets take a look at the repositories block. In this example
   we are using the ~mavenCentral~ repository. This is a list of the
   repositories for gradle to look for dependencies. We can see in the
   dependencies block of our example =build.gradle= that we will require ~junit~
   for testing so lets do a quick google search for junit and see if we can find
   it in [[https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit][~mavenCentral~]]. It is also worth noting that gradle caches dependencies
   when we pull them from the web so we don't have to download them every time
   we run our code, the cache of these dependencies can be found in ~/.gradle/~:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :noweb yes
     tree -L 2 ~/.gradle/
   #+END_SRC
   *Outputs*:

   We aren't limited to just ~mavenCentral~ mind you we can add other
   repositories in this block but I won't go over those here.
