/*Great work! Methods are a powerful way to abstract tasks away and make them repeatable. They allow us to define behavior for classes, so that the Objects we create can do the things we expect them to. Letâ€™s review everything we have learned about methods so far.

Defining a method : Methods have a method signature that declares their return type, name, and parameters
Calling a method : Methods are invoked with a . and ()
Parameters : Inputs to the method and their types are declared in parentheses in the method signature
Changing Instance Fields : Methods can be used to change the value of an instance field
Scope : Variables only exist within the domain that they are created in
Return : The type of the variables that are output are declared in the method signature
As you move through more Java material, it will be helpful to frame the tasks you create in terms of methods. This will help you think about what inputs you might need and what output you expect.*/
