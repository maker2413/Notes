#+TITLE: Kubernetes Components
#+PROPERTY: header-args

Kubernetes is made up of multiple components that work together to make the
Kubernetes ecosystem. Some of these components only run on the master node and
some run on your other nodes. We will cover the master node or control plane
components first. You can find more information on the Kubernetes componenets:
[[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/][here]].

* Control plane components
  The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for
  example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events
  (for example, starting up a new Pod when a deployment's replicas field is
  unsatisfied). Control plane components can be run on any machine in the
  cluster. However, for simplicity, set up scripts typically start all control
  plane components on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this
  machine
  - kube-apiserver
    The api server is the component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes
    the Kubernetes api. The api server is the front end of the Kubernetes
    control plane and is designed to scale horizontally. You can run several
    instances of the kube-apiserver and balance traffic between those instances.
  - etcd
    The etcd component is the consistent and highly-available key value store
    used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data. If your Kubernetes
    cluster uses etcd as its backing store, make sure you have a back up plan
    for your data. More inforamtion on backing up etcd can be found here:
    [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#backing-up-an-etcd-cluster][backing up etcd]].
  - kube-scheduler
    The kube-scheduler is the control plane component that watches for newly
    created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.
    Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include: individual and
    collective resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints,
    affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload
    interference, and deadlines.
  - kube-controller-manager
    The kube-controller-manager is the control plane component that runs
    controller processes. Logically, each controller is a separate process, but
    to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in
    a single process. Some types of these controllers are:
    - Node controller :: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
    - Job controller :: Wathes for job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion.
    - Endpoints controller :: Populates the endpoints object (that is, joins Services and Pods).
    - Service Account & Token controllers :: Create default accounts and api access tokens for new namespaces.
  - cloud-controller-manager
    The cloud-controller-manager is the control plane component that embeds
    cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you link
    your cluster into your cloud provider's api, and separates out the
    components that interact with that cloud platform form components that
    interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with
    your cluster. The cloud-controller-manager only runs controllers that are
    specific to your cloud provider. If you are running Kubernetes on your own
    premises, or in a learning environment inside your own PC, the cluster does
    not have a cloud-controller-manager. As with the kube-controller-manager,
    the cloud-controller-manager combines several logically independent control
    loops into a single binary that you run as a single process. You can scale
    horizontally (run more than one copy) to improve performance or to help
    tolerate failures. The following controllers can have cloud provider
    dependencies:
    - Node controller :: For checking the cloud provider to determine if a node has been deleted in the cloud after it stops responding.
    - Route controller :: For setting up routes in the underlying cloud infrastructure.
    - Service controller :: For creating, updating, and deleting cloud provider load balancers.

* Node Components
  Node components run on every node, maintaining running Pods and providing the
  Kubernetes runtime environment. Here are the node components:
  - kubelet
    The kubelet component is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It
    makes sure that containers are running in a Pod. The kubelet takes a set of
    PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the
    controller described in those PodSpecs are running healthy. The kubelet
    doesn't manage controllers which were not created by Kubernetes.
  - kube-proxy
    The kube-proxy component is a network proxy that runs on each node in your
    cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept. The kube-proxy
    maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network
    communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your
    cluster. The kube-proxy uses the operating system packet filtering layer if
    there is one and it's available. Otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic
    itself.
  - container runtime
    The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running
    containers. Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: Docker,
    containerd, CRI-O, and any implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container
    Runtime Interface).
