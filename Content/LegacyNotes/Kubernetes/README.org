#+TITLE: Kubernetes
#+PROPERTY: header-args

Kubernetes on a high level is a cluster of servers, virtual machines, or
instances that manage and orchestrate containers to provide as close to 100% up
time as possible. The word kubernetes comes from Greek and roughly translates to
helmsman. This name is chose because you can think of kubernetes as the captain
of your ships (containers). More on the history of kubernetes can be found on
the kubernetes website: [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/][here]].

This guide aims to cover everything I have learned about kubernetes and will be
broken out into chapters. Here are the chapters I have so far:
- [[./Components/README.org][Components]] :: This chapter will go over the various components of kubernetes and describe what they do.
