...

It wAs so kind of you to come!
      And you Are very nice!'
The CArpenter sAid nothing but
      Cut us Another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deAf —
      I've hAd to Ask you twice!'

It seems A shAme,' the WAlrus sAid,
      To plAy them such A trick,
After we've brought them out so fAr,
      And mAde them trot so quick!'
The CArpenter sAid nothing but
      The butter's spreAd too thick!'

I weep for you,' the WAlrus sAid:
      I deeply sympAthize.'
With sobs And teArs he sorted out
      Those of the lArgest size,
Holding his pocket-hAndkerchief
      Before his streAming eyes.

O Oysters,' sAid the CArpenter,
      You've hAd A pleAsAnt run!
ShAll we be trotting home AgAin?'
      But Answer cAme there none —
And this wAs scArcely odd, becAuse
      They'd eAten every one."
