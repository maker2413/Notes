Org mode is one of the many text editing modes in emacs. On a surface level it
is used to write READMEs and to make to do lists. Once you get deeper into org
mode you will find that org mode can be used in many aspects of your life. These
are just some notes I have on the neat features I use in org mode however the
full org mode guide can be find on their [[https://orgmode.org/][website]]. Org is actually way too
complex for me cover in this simple Notes repo and the full guide should
definitely be referenced to full take advantage of org mode. This guide simple
exists for me to show some of the simple features I find useful in org mode.

* Headlines
  Headlines are what org mode refers to as the headers you see in this document.
  Headlines in org mode are simply started with an =*=:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ,* This is a headline
    ,** This is a smaller sub headline
    ,*** We can keep making them smaller
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  One of the many features of headlines in org mode is that headlines can be
  folded. What I mean by this is pressing ~tab~ on any headline will collapse it
  out of view. These folded headlines can be reexpanded by pressing ~tab~ again.
  You also can press ~shift-tab~ to fold every headline in your current buffer.
  Similar to a single fold you can reopen every headline in your current buffer
  by pressing twice: ~shift-tab shift-tab~.

** Tasks
  One of the interesting things about org mode is that Headlines can easily be
  turned into a TODO item by typing ~C-c C-t~. If you are sure what this
  notation means please refer to the emacs manual for how emacs key notation is
  written: [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsKeyNotation][Emacs wiki]]. By default this will mark you Headline as ~TODO~ and
  pressing it again will mark your headline as ~DONE~. So a simple TODO list
  could look like this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
    ,* DONE Start Document on Org mode
    ,* TODO Finish document on Org mode
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  Combining a TODO list with folding is a great way to keep track of a lot of
  things without information overload.

* Lists
  Org mode supports many types of lists and these can also be useful to keep
  track of your work progress or tasks in life.

* Random Notes
  - M-enter creates a new heading at current level
  - Tab on new blank heading indents it
    - Tab again will cycle through other indentation options
  - You can toggle TODO status of headings with S-right, S-left, or C-c C-t
