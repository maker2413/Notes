Typescript is a progamming language that is based on Javascript. In fact
Typescript is just Javascript with added syntax for types. The type system of
typescript has many key features that it adds, some of these are:
- Helps to catch errors *during development*
- Uses 'type annotations' to analyze code
- Only active *during* development
  This simply means that all typescript code when compiled into Javascript
  doesn't stick around and the machine running the javascript code ie: a web
  browser has no idea what typescript even is.
- Doesn't provide any performance optimization

For the fact that Typescript compiles to Javascript and doesn't have any of its
syntax left over going forward we can think of Typescript as Javascript with
annotations.

Please refer to my Javascript notes for any unfamiliarity with Javascript: [[../JavaScript/README.org][Notes]]
