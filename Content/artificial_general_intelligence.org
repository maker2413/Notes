An artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical intelligent agent
which can understand or learn any intellectual task that human beings or other
animals can. AGI has also been defined alternatively as an autonomous system
that surpasses human capabilities at the majority of economically valuable
work. Developing AGI is a primary goal of some [[id:1685a9c2-92ca-4d13-9438-c343769474de][artificial intelligence]] research
and for several [[id:1685a9c2-92ca-4d13-9438-c343769474de][AI]] companies such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, as well as
a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.
