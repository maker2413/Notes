Binary is a numbering scheme consisting of 2 digits (0 and 1). This can also be
referred to as a base 2 number system. We as humans normally deal with a base 10
numbering system in our life ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Binary or base 2
is just one of an infinite amount of numbering systems. Computers work with a
base 2 numbering system because down at component level computers interpret base
2 as 0 being no electricity in a component and 1 as being electricity in a
component.
