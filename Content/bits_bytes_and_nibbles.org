You may have heard of bits or bytes before and you had no idea what that
meant. Well bit, bytes, and the lesser known nibble are all used as measurements
for the length of a [[id:c7cc03ef-ed81-4f63-b5f8-ed0b4963aa9b][Binary]] number.

Here is a quick table that shows what each one represents:
| Length | Name   |  Example |
|--------+--------+----------|
|      1 | Bit    |        0 |
|      4 | Nibble |     1001 |
|      8 | Byte   | 11010110 |
