The ~cd~ tool is used in the [[id:8f8d4797-dca7-4e7f-afcb-b12fa196d412][Linux]] command line to change the directory you are
currently in to the directory specified. To move up one directory run:
~cd ..~. This works because in [[id:8f8d4797-dca7-4e7f-afcb-b12fa196d412][Linux]] ~.~ is used to represent your current
working directory and ~..~ is used to represent the directory above your current
directory.

For any more information on ~cd~ please refer to the [[id:97b6c627-602e-4a30-837b-75555a7eae94][Man]] page of ~cd~.
