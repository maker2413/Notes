In programming languages, conditionals (also known as conditional statements,
conditional expressions, and conditional constructs), are how we handle
decisions in our programs. Specifically, conditionals perform different
operations based on whether a programmer defined condition evaluates to true or
false.

  The most basic form of conditionals is the ~if~ statement. Almost every
  programming language has some form of ~if~ statement. We use ~if~ statements
  to execute a block of code "if" a definded condition is true for our program.
  Most programming languages use the almost same syntax for ~if~ statements,
  lets look at some examples:
  - Bash:
    #+begin_src bash
      if [[ $NUM -gt 10 ]]
      then
         echo "$NUM is greater than 10."
      fi
    #+end_src
  - C:
    #+begin_src c
      if (num > 10) {
        printf("%d is greater than 10.", num);
      }
    #+end_src
  - Java:
    #+begin_src java
      if (num > 10) {
        system.out.println(num + 'is greater than 10.');
      }
    #+end_src
  - Python:
    #+begin_src python
      if num > 10:
        print(num + "is greater than 10.");
    #+end_src

    The other half of an if/else statement is the ~else~ statement. We use
    ~else~ to define what we want our program to execute if we didn't fulfill
    the condition of our ~if~ statement. Most programming languages also support
    an ~elseif~ statement. An ~elseif~ statement is essentially followup if
    statements we want to check for before falling back on our ~else~
    statement. Lets add some ~elseif~ and ~else~ statements to our examples
    above:
  - Bash:
    #+begin_src bash
      if [[ $NUM -gt 10 ]]
      then
        echo "$NUM is greater than 10."
      elif [[ $NUM -lt 10 ]]
      then
        echo "$NUM is less than 10."
      else
        echo "$NUM is 10."
      fi
    #+end_src
  - C:
    #+begin_src c
      if (num > 10) {
        printf("%d is greater than 10.", num);
      }
      else if (num < 10) {
        printf("%d is less than 10.", num);
      }
      else {
        printf("%d is 10.", num);
      }
    #+end_src
  - Java:
    #+begin_src java
      if (num > 10) {
        system.out.println(num + 'is greater than 10.');
      } else if (num < 10) {
        System.out.println(num + 'is less than 10.');
      } else {
        System.out.println(num + 'is 10.');
      }
    #+end_src
  - Python:
    #+begin_src python
      if num > 10:
        print(num + "is greater than 10.");
      elif num < 10:
        print(num + "is less than 10.");
      else:
        print(num + "is 10.");
    #+end_src
