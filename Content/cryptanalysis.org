You use Cryptanalysis to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access
to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.

Cryptanalysis is the inverse of cryptography. It's the study of how to break
secret codes, not make them. Having a solid understanding of cryptanalysis is
fundamental in cryptography, however, as one must know their enemy.
