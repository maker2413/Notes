Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in
the presence of third parties called adversaries.

People often lazily use Cryptography in place of the word cryptology, but in
reality, cryptography focuses only on creating secure cryptosystems. For
example, the design of RSA would have been cryptography work.
