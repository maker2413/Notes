Declarative programming is a [[id:5bf321c2-18e7-4893-9223-3eb54d411de1][programming paradigm]] that emphasizes a style of
building the structure of elements of computer programs that expresses the logic
of a computation without describing its control flow.

Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side
effects by describing *what* the program must accomplish in terms of problem
domain, rather than describing *how* to accomplish it as a sequence of the
programming language primitives. This is in contrast to [[id:65243545-0a66-4896-a6ce-1524ea4c316c][imperative programming]],
which implements algorithms in explicit steps.

The main branches of declarative programming include:
- [[id:1eacdca5-f35d-4a9b-90ed-56f260b4c723][Functional Programming]]
- [[id:e3de8a82-7b93-497d-ad61-ab4a55864834][Logic Programming]]
- [[id:d32a4d32-c243-4a00-b420-51e70177b582][Reactive Programming]]
