ELisp, or Emacs Lisp, is the programming language used to configure and extend
functionality in [[id:d18ed6e8-dbce-4822-9d3f-3de38246ba38][Emacs]]. ELisp is built off of [[id:43d75a03-0ec5-4068-b1cd-e23a0bb51cab][Common Lisp]] and shares much of the
syntax. ELisp was made specifically for the purpose of extending Emacs. Much of
the Emacs source code is written in ELisp. Some of the low level functionality
is built in C (like the interpreter for ELisp), but most of the built in
libraries and functions are written in ELisp.
