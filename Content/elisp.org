ELisp, or Emacs Lisp, is the programming language used to configure and extend
functionality in [[id:d18ed6e8-dbce-4822-9d3f-3de38246ba38][Emacs]]. ELisp is built off of [[id:85dcb828-5822-4d77-a826-e276d6c5e007][Lisp]] and shares much of the
syntax. ELisp was made specifically for the purpose of extending [[id:d18ed6e8-dbce-4822-9d3f-3de38246ba38][Emacs]]. Much of
the [[id:d18ed6e8-dbce-4822-9d3f-3de38246ba38][Emacs]] source code is written in ELisp. Some of the low level functionality
is built in C (like the interpreter for ELisp), but most of the built in
libraries and functions are written in ELisp.
