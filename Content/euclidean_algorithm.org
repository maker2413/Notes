In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient
method for computing the [[id:b10f13f9-4db7-4eba-bf9e-e6715740dab5][gcd]] of two numbers, the largest number that divides
them both without a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician
[[id:6f15d202-7913-4c86-8b5d-a23ec74e20f9][Euclid]], who first described it in 300 BC.
