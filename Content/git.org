Git is a version control software originally started by Linux Toralds (The
creator of Linux). It was designed as an alternative to other version control
software like [[https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/][CVS]] or [[https://subversion.apache.org/][SVN]]. It differs from its competitors in that each user
clones down the entire contents of the repository to their machine and push up
changes that they make locally, only requiring the user to connect to the server
to save their work.

If you are trying to learn git I recommend the git tutorial:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial.

I'm not going to give too in depth of a tutorial, but I will explain some basic
operations that are common with ~git~ and explain my way through them.

* Cloning down a repository
  As you can read above what makes ~git~ different from some of the other
  version control software out there ~git~ has a concept of a remote repository
  of code and that users clone down a copy of the code. For an example let's
  look at how you would clone down the [[https://github.com/maker2413/notes][repository]] that these notes are generated
  from:
  #+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/maker2413/Notes.git
  #+end_src

  This will clone down a copy of this repository to your computer in your
  current working directory. I do however want to take a moment to mention ssh
  keys with regards to git because I think is a vast superior way to interact
  with remote repositories. A great guide on generating an ssh key can be found
  here:
  https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key.

  Once you have an ssh key created you will just need to add the public key to
  the remote git server, which in this case of this repo is [[id:0c164614-cdac-4936-aca3-a6cb340883fa][GitHub]], however
  [[id:0856b32b-1060-4fcb-9a42-5382b11deb47][GitLab]] is also a popular public remote.

* Git config
  With the ~git~ cli you can configure almost any feature you could want to
  configure. Something cool about git configuration is that you can have both a
  global configuration, normally found in ~$HOME/.git/~, and you can have a git
  config local to a repo.

  Running ~git config <option> <value>~ will set it locally, while using:
  ~git config --global <option> <value>~ will set it globally. I'm not going to
  get into everything you can configure for git, but I am going to point out one
  of the config options to set early on.
  #+begin_src bash
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"
  #+end_src

  You can see the list of config options with: ~git config --global --list~.

* Creating a commit
  When you have made changes to a repo and you would like to push your changes
  up to the git server you need to first make a commit. To make a commit first
  you should run:
  #+name: status
  #+begin_src bash :results verbatim
    git status
  #+end_src

  In my case if I run this right now I get the following:
  #+RESULTS: status
  #+begin_example
  On branch master
  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
          modified:   git.org

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
  #+end_example

  You can even see in that output that ~git~ is trying to tell us what to do
  next. We want to do ~git add~ on any files we want to include in the
  commit. Note you can add all changes ~git add *~, but I would break that
  habbit if you have it or never do that to begin with as adding all files and
  blindly committing can lead to unintentionally pushing up confidential
  information.

  After you add the files you want to commit you can simply run ~git commit~ to
  create a commit. You should be dropped into the default text editor on your
  system to add a commit message. You can also write your commit message with
  the ~-m~ flag, skipping over the editor step.
  #+begin_src bash
    git add git.org
    git commit -m "adding more context and examples to git doc"
  #+end_src

* Pushing and pulling
  Once you have one or more commits and you would like to push them up to the
  remote git server you can simply run ~git push~. It is wise, however to
  pull down any new changes that may be out on the remote. This can easily
  happen if you are collaborating with others. To pull down changes simply run:
  ~git pull~.
  #+begin_src bash
    git pull
    git push
  #+end_src

* Subtree Commands
  - ~git remote add -f <repoAlias> <repoURL> [--squash]~
  - ~git subtree add --prefix <subtreePath> <repoAlias> <branch> [--squash]~
  - ~git subtree push --prefix <subtreePath> <repoAlias> <branch>~
  - ~git subtree pull --prefix <subtreePath> <repoAlias> <branch>~
