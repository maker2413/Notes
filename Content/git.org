Git is a version control software originally started by Linux Toralds (The
creator of Linux). It was designed as an alternative other version control
software like [[https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/][CVS]] or [[https://subversion.apache.org/][SVN]]. It differs from its competitors in that each user
clones down the entire contents of the repository to their machine and push up
changes that they make locally, only requiring the user to connect to the server
to save their work.
