Go is a statically typed, compiled [[id:94903e09-f03d-4b20-b2eb-1da7618282ee][programming language]] designed at Google by
Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to [[id:a8cd1fe3-5197-44a1-a67d-e876e444cd85][C]],
but with memory safety, garbage collection, and structural typing.

Before we dive into how Go works I want to point out some useful
resources. First off I personally think [[https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/][this]] is the best guide for learning
Go. I also wanted to take the time to link to [[https//go.dev][go.dev]] the homepage of Go and
specifically the [[https://go.dev/play][Playground]] where you can access a live Go environment where you
can look at example, write, and run Go programs.

With that out of the way lets go over some go concepts.
