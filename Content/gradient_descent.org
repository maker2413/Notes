Gradient descent is most common taught during [[id:606c5657-c0f5-4bce-9a24-54c08274a6fa][Calculus]] in school.

Gradient descent is an algorithm that numerically estimates where a function
outputs its lowest values. That means it finds local minima, but not by setting:
\begin{equation}
\[\nabla f = 0\]
\end{equation}

Instead of finding minima by manipulating symbols, gradient descent approximates
the solution with numbers. Furthermore, all it needs in order to run is a
function's numerical output, no formula required.
