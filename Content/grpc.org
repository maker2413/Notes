gRPC is an open-source framework for implementing APIs that uses HTTP/2. It is a
cross-platform high performance [[id:c45b29f6-947b-4a48-b97b-5b75723a2e5f][remote procedure call]] framework. gRPC differs
from RPC in a number of ways, but the most important of these is that gRPC
supports many different programming languages and allows the sender or the
receiver to be written in an entirely different language than the other if
needed. This is accomplished by communicating using [[id:ba99b177-ac32-47e8-a51d-71b9a88a8d4f][Protobuf]] data.

There are also two tools that have been developed to automatically generate [[id:037f18dd-1b13-4cfe-a44e-ae410426f90e][Go]]
code to write and read protobufs called [[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go][protoc-gen-go]] and
[[https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc][protoc-gen-go-grpc]]. These can be installed with the following:
#+begin_src shell
  go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
  go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
#+end_src
