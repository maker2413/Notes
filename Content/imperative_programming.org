Imperative programming is a [[id:5bf321c2-18e7-4893-9223-3eb54d411de1][programming paradigm]] that uses [[id:1cf21d86-3f1b-49ea-87ec-1a2a270d2b59][statements]] that
change a program's state. Imperative programming focuses on describing *how* a
program operates step by step, rather than on high-level descriptions of its
expected results.

The term imperative programming is often used in contrast to
[[id:1d980013-4a8b-4249-90f0-1ba4f327adba][declarative programming]], which focuses on *what* the program should accomplish
without specifying the details of *how* the program should achieve the result.

The two main branches of imperative programming are:

- [[id:ae9096c3-0fcc-4686-9918-a1f7949af73c][Object Oriented Programming]]
