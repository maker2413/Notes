#+TITLE: Notes

This is my notes repo, and is a collection of guides I have put together over
topics I have learned. As of right now this repo is a quite a work in progress
but ultimately I would love for the notes here to be a collection of everything
I have learned in my career. I have recently been working on updating these
notes to a more in depth layout that will make more sense to newcomers. If you
would like to see my old notes please refer to the [[./LegacyNotes/README.org][LegacyNotes]] directory.

As of right now you can check out these guides to begin diving into my notes:
