#+TITLE: Notes

This is my notes repo, and is a collection of guides I have put together over
topics I have learned. As of right now this repo is a quite a work in progress
but ultimately I would love for the notes here to be a collection of everything
I have learned in my career. I have recently been working on updating these
notes to a more in depth layout that will make more sense to newcomers. If you
would like to see my old notes please refer to the [[./LegacyNotes/README.org][LegacyNotes]] directory.

As of right now you can check out these guides to begin diving into my notes:

- [[id:aa1519cc-d56c-4fbf-90bd-ea284b8d706f][Tools]]

Also be sure to check out my one-off notes:
- [[id:a67cff5b-1fc5-4ed4-8daa-dede88c97261][OneOffs]]

Information on what exactly you are looking at or how this website is made can
be found here: [[id:309a008f-9aca-4074-951b-287f3fe27506][How This Website Is Made]].

Some day I would like to have a "mind map" also be published with this
website. I want it to look something like what the [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]] package displays
currently. It would look something like this:
