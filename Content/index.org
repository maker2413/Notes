These are my notes, and a collection of guides I have put together over topics I
have learned. As of right now this website is quite a work in progress but
ultimately I would love for the notes on this site to be a collection of
everything I have learned in my career and personal life. I have recently been
working on updating these notes to a more in depth layout that will make more
sense to newcomers. If you would like to see my old notes please refer to my
[[./LegacyNotes/README.org][LegacyNotes]].

Some day I would like to have a "mind map" also be published with this
website. I want it to look something like what the [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]] package displays
currently. It would look something like this:
