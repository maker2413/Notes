Sir Isaac Newton FRS was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer,
alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural
philosopher. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the
Enlightenment that followed. His pioneering book Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia
Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in
1687, consolidated many previous results and established classical
mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit
with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal
calculus.
