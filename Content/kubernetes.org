Kubernetes on a high level is a cluster of servers, virtual machines, or
instances that manage and orchestrate containers to provide as close to 100% up
time as possible. The word Kubernetes comes from Greek and roughly translates to
helmsman. This name was chosen because you can think of Kubernetes as the
captain of your ships (containers). More on the history of Kubernetes can be
found on the Kubernetes website: [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/][here]].

This guide aims to cover everything I have learned about Kubernetes and will be
broken out into chapters. Here are the chapters I have so far:
