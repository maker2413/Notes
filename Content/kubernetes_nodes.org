A Kubernetes cluster generally consists of a Control Plane node (formerly called
a master node) and some amount of worker nodes (formerly called minions),
although it is possible to only have a control plane node and no workers. The
control plane node is used to manage all of the worker nodes and is the central
point where commands are work loads are sent by the user(s) of the cluster.
