A Kubernetes Operator, sometimes called a controller, manages orchestration
through a series of watch-loops. Each controller interrogates the [[id:26364aaa-416e-46e5-ab00-fa94fe74f24c][kube-apiserver]]
for a particular object state, then modifying the object until the declared
state matches the current state. These controllers are compiled into the
[[id:26364aaa-416e-46e5-ab00-fa94fe74f24c][kube-controller-manager]], but others can be added using custom resource
definitions. The default operator for containers is called a [[id:42abcbf0-bb4d-4e70-9f90-31bf190842ec][Deployment]]. A
[[id:42abcbf0-bb4d-4e70-9f90-31bf190842ec][Deployment]] does not directly work with pods, but instead manages [[id:bd7528e0-64d4-40f9-9295-71b820be5186][Replicasets]].
