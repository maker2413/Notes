In Kubernetes Containers are not managed individually, but instead they are part
of a larger object called a Pod. A Pod in Kubernetes consists of one or more
containers which share an IP address, access to storage, and
[[id:72262b9e-6080-47ca-85eb-c22b651e7d92][namespace]]. Typically, one container in a Pod runs an application, while the
other containers support the primary application.
