In Kubernetes Containers are not managed individually, but instead they are part
of a larger object called a Pod. A Pod in Kubernetes consists of one or more
containers which share an IP address, access to storage, and
[[id:7d58f850-096d-40c6-8b0f-64b92acba2b8][namespace]]. Typically, one container in a Pod runs an application, while the
other containers support the primary application.
