The idea behind limits is to calculate what a problem will become as it
approaches a limit like for instance infinity or an indeterminate
answer. Sometimes we can't work something out directly, but we can see what it
should be as we closer to our answer.

Let's take a look at the following example:
\begin{equation}
\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}
\end{equation}

For this example let's work it out
