* LS
  Here is some more information on ls -lah since you asked Carrie: So the -lah bit
  is actually 3 separate flags we are giving the ls command and if you wanted to
  see what each of those does you can run ls --help to see the help menu for ls:
  <see attached screenshot>

  For a brief description though the -l flag gives a longer output to ls and will
  show things like permissions, who owns them, and file size for the files and
  directories output. The -a flag will show all the files and directories (this
  includes files and directories that begin with . as these are normally hidden
  from output). And finally the -h flag provides headers at the top of the output,
  these are essentially just to make the output prettier.

  The only other thing worth noting are that ls -lah is the same as typing ls -a
  -l -h or ls -ahl . In bash or zsh (the default shell on Mac) you can pass flags
  to a command in any order or even multiple chained together like ls -l -a -h and
  if you are ever curious about the flags on a command most commands will show a
  help menu when you type --help ie:  ls --help , although this isnâ€™t always the
  case and in cases like that you can read the manual for the command in question
  with man ie: man ls.
