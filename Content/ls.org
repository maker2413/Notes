The ~ls~ tool is used to list file and directories in the specified directory or
your current directory if one isn't specified. For example running: ~ls /~ would
show all the files and directories on the root of the hard drive.

Some important flags to ~ls~ command to know are:
- ~-a~ :: shows hidden and 'dot' files
- ~-h~ :: adds a header row to each column
- ~-l~ :: displays extended file metadata as a table

These flags can also be chained together like this: ~ls -lah~. For any more
information on the ~ls~ tool please refer to the [[id:97b6c627-602e-4a30-837b-75555a7eae94][Man]] page for ~ls~.
