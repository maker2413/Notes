Machine learning (ML) is a field devoted to understanding and building methods
that let machines "learn" â€“ that is, methods that leverage data to improve
computer performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a broad subfield of
artificial intelligence.

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as
training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being
explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide
variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech
recognition, agriculture, and computer vision, where it is difficult or
unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics,
which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine
learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization
delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine
learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data
analysis through unsupervised learning.

Some implementations of machine learning use data and [[id:054e88d7-a63b-4422-a2de-ed2c120f312c][neural networks]] in a way
that mimics the working of a biological brain.
