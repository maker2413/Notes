Markdown is a [[id:7d97f527-f387-44c0-86c9-4dbbe0ab28e0][markup language]] and quite possibly the most common one for
documenting code. If you have ever encountered a file that ends in ~.md~ before;
that is a Markdown file. If you have ever looked at projects on [[id:0c164614-cdac-4936-aca3-a6cb340883fa][GitHub]], [[id:0856b32b-1060-4fcb-9a42-5382b11deb47][GitLab]],
or any other code hosting platform you have seen README files written in
Markdown. For this reason it can be quite vital to at least know the basics of
Markdown if you are going to be making projects that you would like to
document.
