Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers,
formulas and related structures, shapes, and the spaces in which they are
contained. More importantly a general understanding of math and a decent skill
of crafting formulas is almost a most if you want to get into many topics in
computing.

Here are some of the notes I have on some areas of Math:
- [[id:ae43a2af-8778-4311-b570-d79f764976a0][Algebra]]
- [[id:e15a65f3-75ef-4e57-91ab-49a4c6c5694b][Geometry]]
- [[id:606c5657-c0f5-4bce-9a24-54c08274a6fa][Calculus]]

Here are also some notes I have on some math concepts:
- [[id:4273b62e-2f6c-4e10-b5fc-aafbcb960a0b][Integer Factorization]]
- [[id:b25c0b37-8ca1-44bb-a3cc-bb0a15f85680][Prime Factorization]]
- [[id:aa358af6-0bcf-4d5f-95c3-69c4104ee6b1][Prime Numbers]]
- [[id:b10f13f9-4db7-4eba-bf9e-e6715740dab5][Greatest Common Divisor]]

Finally here are some notes I have on Mathematicians:
- [[id:6f15d202-7913-4c86-8b5d-a23ec74e20f9][Euclid]]

*Many of these are still a work in progress*
