Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers,
formulas and related structures, shapes, and the spaces in which they are
contained. More importantly a general understanding of math and a decent skill
of crafting formulas is almost a most if you want to get into many topics in
computing.

Here are some of the notes I have on some areas of Math:

- [[id:e15a65f3-75ef-4e57-91ab-49a4c6c5694b][Geometry]]
- [[id:606c5657-c0f5-4bce-9a24-54c08274a6fa][Calculus]]

*Many of these are still a work in progress*
