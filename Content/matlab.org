MATLAB (an abbreviation of MATrix LABoratory) is a proprietary multi-paradigm
[[id:94903e09-f03d-4b20-b2eb-1da7618282ee][programming language]] and numeric computing environment develop by
MathWorks. MATLAB is considered to be a fourth generation [[id:94903e09-f03d-4b20-b2eb-1da7618282ee][programming language]].

MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data,
