MLOps is a newer career path in the computer field that aims to deploy and
maintain machine learning models in a reliable and efficient way. MLOps stands
for "Machine Learning Operations" and is sort of an offshoot of [[id:f95e3523-9d90-4089-8d18-05277c908406][DevOps]] and as
such it can be easier for a [[id:f95e3523-9d90-4089-8d18-05277c908406][DevOps engineer]] to get into MLOps than it can be for
an [[id:ee2e1560-29ac-4760-8387-e84ecb97dcd8][ML engineer]].

Some of the different things that an MLOps engineer would do in a production
setting would be:
- Data collection and preparation
- Model development and training
- ML service deployment
- Continuous feedback and monitoring
