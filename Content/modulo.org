Modulo is a [[id:36a1bacc-e7f2-4737-881d-b243a291d8df][mathematical]] [[id:df70107c-3adf-4c58-987d-cf74be9e149f][operator]] commonly found in computing. The modulo
operator will return the remainder of a division operation.

For instance if wanted to know what the remainder of 17 and 7 was we could do
something like this:
#+name: modulo
#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
  print(17 % 7)
#+end_src

In this case would get a remainder of:
#+RESULTS: modulo
: 3

Now for that example I used [[id:523160d7-c44e-4126-a606-8e8ff64936cc][Python]], but almost any programming language has a
modulo [[id:df70107c-3adf-4c58-987d-cf74be9e149f][operator]].
