A neural network can refer to either a neural circuit of biological neurons
(sometimes also called a biological neural network), or a network of artificial
neurons or nodes (in the case of an artificial neural network). Artificial
neural networks are used for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems; they
model connections of biological neurons as weights between nodes. A positive
weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory
connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is
referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls
the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is
usually between 0 and 1, or it could be âˆ’1 and 1.

These artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control
and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-learning
resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive
conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.
