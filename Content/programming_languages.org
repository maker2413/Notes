Programming is the act of giving a set of instructions to a computer to
execute. If you think of it like cooking using a recipe you can think of
yourself as the computer and the recipe's author would be the programmer. The
recipe book would be code and the language of the book would be the programming
language. The most complex the recipe the more complex the final result will
be.

Computers think in [[id:c7cc03ef-ed81-4f63-b5f8-ed0b4963aa9b][binary]] and programming languages allow us to translate the 1s
and 0s into something that is more human readable. A programming language is
just a series of symbols that serve as a bridge that allow humans to translate
our thoughts into instructions that computers can understand.

Here are some of the programming languages I have covered so far:
