In computer science, pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in
an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of
a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than
machine reading. It typically omits details that are essential for machine
understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations and
language-specific code. The programming language is augmented with natural
language description details, where convenient, or with compact mathematical
notation. The purpose of using pseudocode is that it is easier for people to
understand than conventional programming language code, and that it is an
efficient and environment-independent description of the key principles of an
algorithm. It is commonly used in textbooks and scientific publications to
document algorithms and in planning of software and other algorithms.
