A regular expression, sometimes also referred to RegExp or regex, is a sequence
of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually these patterns are used
to search text or a file that is passed into a string searching program or
algorithm. Regular expressions are important to know because sometimes when you
are working with computers you will need to a find a specific pattern of text
and regular expressions will allow you to define how this pattern should
look. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards (~*.txt~) on steroids.
