  In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps,
  or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building
  software-as-a-service apps that:
  - Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for
    new developers joining the project;
  - Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum
    portability between execution environments;
  - Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for
    servers and systems administration;
  - Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous
    deployment for maximum agility;
  - And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or
    development practices.

  The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming
  language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue,
  memory cache, etc).
