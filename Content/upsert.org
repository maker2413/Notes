~upsert~ I believe comes from the mysql world is, from what I understand, a
mashup of ~insert~ and ~delete~. Instead of deleting a record and then inserting
the new value you want you can run an ~upsert~ which will update the record if
it exists and insert it if its doesn't currently exist. ~upsert~ is used as a
term outside of mysql now like Kapp from the k14s suite.
