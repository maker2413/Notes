Windows is the most popular desktop operating system and I try not to use it as
much as possible. Other than gaming I personally think it has no merit in the
computing world as people that are more tech savvy will be given more freedom
and power with an operating system like [[id:8f8d4797-dca7-4e7f-afcb-b12fa196d412][Linux]], and people that aren't tech savvy
and only use their computer for web browsing can probably get by with something
like a smartphone, tablet, or Chromebook.
