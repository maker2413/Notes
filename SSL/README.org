* Hashing
  Hashing is a technique used in computing to ditermine if a file has changed from an expected state.

* Asymmetric Keys
  Asymmetric keys are a set of keys used to safely send data without it being readable by unwanted parties.

* OpenSSL commands
  This guide will describe how to generate various ssl certs. We will be using the ~openssl~ command, it is used to
  generate ssl certs of many kinds.

** Generate an RSA private key with aes256 encryption
  Here is an example of how to generate an RSA private key:

  #+BEGIN_SRC fish
    openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.pem
  #+END_SRC

  Here we use the ~genrsa~ option to make sure we are generating an ssl key of RSA type. We also passsed the ~-aes256~
  flag to specify we wanted it to have aes256 encryption on the key. Finally we specified the ~-out~ flag to give
  openssl the destination of where we want the private key.

  It is worth noting that the ~-out~ flag is not necessary and the keys text will just be output to the terminal if the
  flag is not provided. If we wanted to specify an rsa key of a certain bit length we can just run the following:

  #+BEGIN_SRC fish
    openssl genrsa 4096
  #+END_SRC

  In this case we would generate an RSA key of 4096 bit length and the key will be output to the terminal.

** Generate an RSA public key from a private key
  Here is an example of how to generate an RSA public key using the private key we made:

  #+BEGIN_SRC fish
    openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
  #+END_SRC

  Here we are using the ~rsa~ option to specify we are working with an rsa file. We then provide the ~-in~ flag and
  give a path to our private key. We are going to use the ~-outform~ flag to specify that we want the output of
  ~openssl~ to be of PEM format. We use the ~-pubout~ flag to specify we want to output a public key from this command.
  Finally we give the ~-out~ flag and list a destination for our public key.
